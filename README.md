Welcome to our e-commerce platform, where seamless integration of Django and React.js powers an immersive shopping experience! This repository combines the robust backend capabilities of Django with the dynamic frontend functionality of React.js, delivering a modern, efficient, and user-friendly online shopping solution.

## Repository Structure:
